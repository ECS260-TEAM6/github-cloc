# github-cloc
This a NodeJS application to automatically get the data for the lines
of code of the repositories. The input of this application is the CSV files generated by
BUILDLOG ANALYZER. It clones repositories from GitHub and by default checkout to 15
commits in the main or master branch of each repository. If the commits are less than 15,
it checkout to all the commits in the main or master branch. The number of commits in
between the selected commits are equal. 

In many cases, GitHub restricted our application
from checkout out some of the commits, so normally the number of results collected for each
repository is less than 15. For each commit, the application count the lines of code of the
main language of the repository using cloc package (https://GitHub.com/AlDanial/cloc) and
stores the results along with input data in a new CSV file as output. 

## To run the app:
Run the following command:
```
node index {directory_containing_build_logs} {programming language}
```

## To debug:
This app could be debugged in vscode vscode
